<h3>Product Specification</h3>
<p> <strong>Indoor Air Quality Detector/Controller</strong><br />
  <strong>Model#: F2000TSM-VOC Series</strong></p>
<p>     <strong>  ■ Real time detect and indicate Indoor Air Quality</strong><br />
  <strong>      ■ High sensitivity to VOC’s and various other indoor air gases</strong><br />
  <strong>      ■ 5~7 years lifetime</strong><br />
  <strong>      ■ Temperature and humidity compensation</strong><br />
  <strong>      ■ Providing 1x 0~10VDC/ 4~20mA linear output for VOC measurement</strong><br />
  <strong>      ■ Modbus RS485 communication interface</strong><br />
  <strong>      ■ Providing 1x dry contact output to control a ventilator</strong><br />
  <strong>      ■ Featured 6 LED indicator lights indicates different IAQ levels</strong><br />
<strong>      ■ The highest performance with the lowest price</strong></p>
<p>         F2000TSM-VOC series is specially   designed to detect room IAQ level with a Modbus RS485 and an optional   linear analog output, as well as an optional relay output to control a   ventilator or an air cleaner based on the pre-set measurement.<br />
  Its internal mixed gas sensor   (normally called VOC sensor) is very sensitive to VOC concentration in   the air (VOC i.e. Volatility Organic Compound, such as timber dope and   toluene emitted by building materials), and other air pollutants such as   cigarette smoke, ammonia and H2S. It also has high sensitivity to CO,   alcohol, natural gas and odorous smells from human bodies. Compared with   other single air sensor, F2000TSM-VOC series is better for longtime IAQ   detection.<br />
F2000TSM-VOC series can also be   used as a controller in application of ventilation and air conditioning   systems to improve indoor air quality and to achieve the best energy   saving.   </p>
<p> <strong>Features</strong><br />
  ◆ Wall mounting, real time detect indoor air quality<br />
  ◆ With Japanese semiconductor mix gas sensor inside. 5~7 years lifetime.<br />
  ◆ High sensitive to contaminative gases   and various kinds of odorous gases within the room (smoke, CO, alcohol,   human odor, material odor).<br />
  ◆ Two types available: indicator and controller<br />
  ◆ Design six indicator lights to indicate six different IAQ ranges.<br />
  ◆ Temperature and humidity compensation makes the IAQ measurements consistent.<br />
  ◆ Modbus RS-485 communication interface, 15KV antistatic protection, independent address setting.<br />
  ◆ Optional one on/off output to control a   ventilator/air cleaner. The user can select an IAQ measurement to   turn-on the ventilator between four setpoints.<br />
  ◆ Optional one 0~10VDC or 4~20mA linear output. </p>
<p> Application<br />
  ◆ Detect Indoor Air Quality<br />
  ◆ Can be used in houses, offices, theaters, shops, restaurants, train stations and many other places<br />
  ◆ Automatically ventilation control</p>
<p> <strong>NOTE：</strong> F2000TSM-VOC detector cannot be used as a safety detector, for example, gas alert detector.</p>
